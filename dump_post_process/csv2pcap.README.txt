This is a postprocessing utility which converts the phy dumps in csv format
to pcap files.
This way the BLE traffic can be analyzed by Wireshark and other tools.

To merge the TX activity from all devices into a single pcap trace do:

$ dump_post_process/csv2pcap -o mytrace.pcap results/<sim_id>/d_2G4*.Tx.csv

Replace paths as necessary.

Alternatively one can merge RX and TX activity from a single device
to get a trace as seen by that device:

$ dump_post_process/csv2pcap -o mytrace.pcap results/<sim_id>/d_2G4_00.{Rx,Tx}.csv

However be careful not to merge Rx and Tx files from different devices
or you'll get duplicated records.
