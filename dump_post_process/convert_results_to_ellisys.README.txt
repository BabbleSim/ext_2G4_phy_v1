This is a postprocessing utility which converts phy dumps of the Tx 
activity of 1 or several devices into the import format for the Ellisys
Bluetooth Analyzer SW uses.
This way the BLE standard (and some industry propietary extensions) traffic can
be analyzed by this Ellisys tool.

Note that all packets which are not BLE modulated won't be coverted (will be 
ignored). 
Note that the Ellisys analyzer SW is _very_ picky, and ignores many packets
which are in some way malformed.
